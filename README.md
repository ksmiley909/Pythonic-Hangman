# Pythonic-Hangman
Hangman game written in Python with random word generated from .txt file
Here we have the classic game of Hangman written in Python. I discovered many approaches to building both the game, 
and the functional execution within it.  Interestingly, a great deal of the code I found was impractical or, in many cases, 
flat out dysfunctional.  After 2-3 weeks of searching, I've arrived at what I feel is a satisfactory blend of all the "best stuff."

Text parsing is of particular personal and proffesional interest, so I was happy to incorporate a simple
implementation here. While writing this program I was often sidetracked by suplemental research regarding text parsing strategies, 
many of which I'm certain will show up in future contributions.  Here the implementation is especially forgiving as the text file has been
formatted nicely,in one long column.  Consequently there were many fewer details to work out, but I'm excited to tackle text parsing in 
"real" scenarios very soon.  Also, there is a fun implementation of the "Random" module and string methods in the text file list 
comprehension. 

From a design persepective, I mulled over several strategies for masking the word of interest.  I've implemented the one I feel is the most
straight forward.  Questions of design are certainly something I look forward to addressing in future projects. 

I have many ideas for future iterations of this program and look forward to adding them when the opportunity presents iself.
